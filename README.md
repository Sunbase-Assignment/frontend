# Sun base Assignment - Customer list
  Basic application that performs CRUD operations on data
  -  sign-in page where authorized users are allowed to perform actions, User authentication is required.
  - Fetching customer data from a MySQL database and displaying it on the front end.

      - Customer data is fetched from the database and rendered in page format with pagination, allowing users to navigate between next or previous pages. The page features an "Add Customer" button to add             new customer data to the database. Following that, there is a "Search by" field and a search input area, enabling users to input search criteria based on the selected field.
      - For each data entry, there is an action field where users can perform edit and delete actions. Additionally, a "Sync" button is available; upon clicking, data is retrieved from a remote API and               stored in the database.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
